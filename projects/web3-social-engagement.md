# Web3 Social Engagement
**Problem**<br>
Communities of Web3 projects relied on manual, round-the-clock coordination to boost social media engagement. This made campaigns inconsistent, time-consuming, and not rewarding.

**My Role**<br>
As Co-Founder and Lead Developer, I designed and developed the platform from concept to production.

**Key Contributions**<br>
- Developed a Telegram bot and full-stack web app to stream tweets with real-time engagement analytics
- Developed an authentication gateway supporting JWT, Telegram login, X OAuth 2.0, and Sign-In with Ethereum
- Developed customizable blueprints with filters, security rules, and gamified rewards via smart contracts (auto buybacks, liquidity adds, XP, leaderboards)
- Integrated a staking smart contract with auto-renewing credits through the web application

**Impact**<br>
- Cut community admin workload by 99% through full automation
- Increased engagement activity by up to 500%, driving stronger campaign reach
- Lowered the entry barrier to Web3 by embedding complex blockchain features into a familiar Telegram experience
