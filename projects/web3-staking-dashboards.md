# Web3 Staking Dashboards
**Problem**<br>
Several Web3 projects deployed staking contracts but lacked user-friendly interfaces. Investors had to rely on Etherscan, which was technical, unintuitive, and prone to user error.

**My Role**<br>
As a Freelance Software Engineer, I designed and developed multiple staking dashboards integrating custom smart contracts.

**Key Contributions**<br>
- Designed and developed five full-stack dApps with Next.js, Express, and Viem
- Integrated wallet connections supporting multiple providers
- Developed an event-driven Telegram bot delivering real-time staking updates

**Impact**<br>
- Enabled traders to collectively stake ~$10M in tokens through the dashboards
- Improved accessibility of complex Web3 interactions for non-technical users
- Strengthened community engagement with real-time feedback via Telegram

**Technology**<br>
